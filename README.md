## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I am not a complete beginner to web development or coding, I am totally self-taught and struggle with some of the finer details. My code often lacks cleanliness and more often than not can appear "hacky". My goal in completing this project was to become more familiar with Frontend Mentor, as this was the first challenge I have completed, and to focus on writing class based styles that are reusable and modular. I think that I was able to accomplish this to some extent.
